# PR Comment Handler

Guide to find the open PR for the current branch and address its comments with gh CLI. Run `gh` in the selected bot workspace, using its configured network access.

Prereq: ensure `gh` is authenticated (for example, run `gh auth login` once), then run `gh auth status` in the selected workspace. A Connect-It connection does not automatically authenticate this CLI. Complete CLI login in this workspace when needed.

## 1) Inspect comments needing attention
- Run scripts/fetch_comments.py which will print out all the comments and review threads on the PR

## 2) Ask the user for clarification
- Number all the review threads and comments and provide a short summary of what would be required to apply a fix for it
- Ask the user which numbered comments should be addressed

## 3) If user chooses comments
- Apply fixes for the selected comments

Notes:
- If gh hits auth/rate issues mid-run, prompt the user to re-authenticate with `gh auth login`, then retry.


## Memoh workspace integration

This Skill is bundled with its App. Resolve `scripts/` and `references/` relative to this Skill directory. Use the selected workspace; follow the user’s repository instructions and existing authorization. Connector authorization and CLI login are separate: check the CLI login before authenticated operations. Never put tokens in chat or committed files.
